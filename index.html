      <h1>A <span class="adjective"></span> <span class="place"></span></h1>
      <p>It was a
        <span class="adjective"></span> and
        <span class="adjective"></span>
        <span class="time"></span>; the
        <span class="weather"></span> fell in torrents, except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a
        <span class="adjective"></span> gust of
        <span class="weather"></span> which swept up the streets (for it is in
        <span class="city"></span> that our scene lies), rattling along the
        <span class="thing"></span>, and fiercely agitating the scanty
        <span class="thing"></span> that struggled against the
        <span class="thing"></span>. Through one of the
        <span class="adjective"></span> quarters of
        <span class="city"></span>, and among haunts little loved by the
        <span class="person"></span>, a man, evidently
        <span class="adjective"></span>, was wending his
        <span class="adjective"></span> way. He stopped twice or thrice at different
        <span class="place"></span> and
        <span class="place"></span> of a description correspondent with the
        <span class="adjective"></span> of the quartier in which they were situated, and
        <span class="verb"></span> for some article or another which did not seem
        <span class="adjective"></span>. All the
        <span class="exclamation"></span> he received were
        <span class="adjective"></span>; and as he turned from each door he
        <span class="verb"></span> to himself, in no very elegant phraseology, his
        <span class="emotion"></span> and
        <span class="emotion"></span>. At length, at one house, the landlord, a
        <span class="adjective"></span>
        <span class="person"></span>, after rendering the same reply
        <span class="person"></span> had hitherto received, added,
        "<span class="quote"></span>" Pausing
        <span class="adverb"></span> for a moment,
        <span class="person"></span> responded that he thought the
        <span class="thing"></span> might do as well; and thrusting it into his ample
        <span class="thing"></span>, he strode away with as rapid a motion as the
        <span class="weather"></span> and the
        <span class="weather"></span> would allow. He soon came to a nest of
        <span class="adjective"></span> and
        <span class="adjective"></span> buildings, at the entrance to which, in
        <span class="adjective"></span> characters, was written "
        <span class="landmark"></span>." Halting at the most
        <span class="adjective"></span> of these buildings, an
        <span class="place"></span> or
        <span class="place"></span>, through the half-closed windows of which blazed out in ruddy comfort the
        <span class="thing"></span>s of the hospitable hearth, he
        <span class="verb"></span> hastily at the door. He was admitted by a
        <span class="person"></span>, and endowed with a comely rotundity of
        <span class="bodypart"></span> and
        <span class="bodypart2"></span>.

      <p id="notes">"It was a dark and stormy night" is an often-mocked and parodied phrase written by English novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton in the opening sentence of his 1830 novel Paul Clifford. This story is based off that famous opening paragraph.</p>
